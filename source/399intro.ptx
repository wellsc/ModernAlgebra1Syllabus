	<title>Learning is fun!</title>
	<p>
		Learning is about feeding our curiosity, stretching ourselves to be better, finding out, and understanding. Those things are all rewarding, which is another word for <em>fun</em>. When learning isn't fun, there is something badly wrong.
	</p>
	<p>
		You know what isn't fun? Grades. Getting them, assigning them, working for them <mdash /> none of these things are fun. They are, in many ways, the <em>opposite</em> of fun.
	</p>
        <p>
                        A growing body of evidence shows essentially no correlation between grades and success in future endeavors. Anecdotal evidence and educational research support the idea that grades, in fact, create a <em>dis-incentive</em> for learning and create incentives for several negative behaviors, including engaging in academic dishonesty, or <q>cheating</q>. Neuroscience research further shows that dopamine is critical for learning, except in the case of learning with punishment. In other words, <em>you need fun to learn</em>.  (See, for example,

<p>One thing we will do in this course is remove the pressure of the grade using a version of what has come to be called <em>ungrading</em>. More details are in
