<p>
For this course, I define professionalism to mean respect for yourself, your classmates, and your instructor. This includes (but is not limited to)
<ul>
    <li>    timely completion of assignments,</li>
    <li>    prompt scheduling of and on-time arrival for individual meetings,</li>
    <li>    preparation for class, and</li>
    <li>    attendance and participation in class. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A pattern of unprofessional behavior during the semester may, at my discretion, result in a course
grade penalty of up to two full letter grades (20%).
