	<title>Ungrading</title>
        <p>
			As mentioned earlier, substantial evidence shows that grades and grading are inherently antithetical to learning. <em>Ungrading</em> shifts the goal of a course from achievement to learning.

        <p>
                It is also important to note that the content of this course is different from a course like Calculus.  In Calculus, the focus is on developing conceptual and procedural fluency with a set of concepts and tools. In Modern Algebra, there is not a particular set of tools, but there is a core collection of mathematical concepts, definitions,  and theorems that you are expected to encounter and understand. 
        </p>
<p>
	Ultimately, though, this is your course. It is you who are the learner, and so you are in the best position to determine what will be of the most interest, will be the most engaging,  and will be of the most value to you, and what is more, you are in the best position to determine how much you have learned. 
	 Therefore, you will be an active participant in determining the direction of the course and in your evaluation.
</p>
<p>
	To put things bluntly, I will determine, based on a body of evidence that you present to me, whether you have done the basic minimum to pass the class. Beyond that, you will determine your own grade, based on your own goals and your own assessment of your learning, as outlined in
