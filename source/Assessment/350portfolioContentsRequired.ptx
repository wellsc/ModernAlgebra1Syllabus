        <introduction>
                <p>
                        The following items are required to be in your portfolio.
                </p>
        </introduction>
        <subsubsection xml:id="self_eval">
                <title>
                        Reader's Guide
                </title>
                <p>
                        For each submission of your portfolio, you will update your reader's guide to discuss your overall progress, and to highlight progress since the last check-in, citing specific items of interest.

                <title>
                        Syntheses of Activities and Readings
                </title>
                <p>
                        Over the course of the semester you will be assigned activities and investigations dealing with various topics in algebra.
                </p>
                <p>
			For each topic we study (not necessarily each activity), you are expected to include a synopsis of the main ideas, including the main mathematical techniques and concepts. You are then expected to reflect and provide a synthesis that discusses what the topic reveals about mathematics, and in particular the mathematical area we call algebra.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like everything in the portfolio, these are works in progress, and you are expected to revisit them in light of later activities or readings that may change your understanding of them.
                </p>
        </subsubsection>
        <subsubsection xml:id="proofs">
		<title>Conjectures and Proofs</title>
		<p>
			There are certain theorems that, together with their proofs, are of vital and central importance to the area of algebra and to the arithmetic of the integers. One of these is the division algorithm, which we will encounter early in the semester. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Equally important as proofs (in my opinion, at least) to the idea of being a mathematician or serious student of mathematics is the development of <em>conjectures</em>. One definition of mathematics is the search for more-or-less universal patterns, and the quantification and justification of their universality. Patterns that seem to appear are <em>conjectures</em>, and attempts at proof and disproof set bounds on their validity and universality. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In an ideal world, you would independently develop, investigate, and validate all of the important theorems of this course through the process of conjecturing, refinement, and eventually proof. Conjecturing, however, is a skill that requires more time and practice to develop than a single semester course allows. Thus, we will develop conjectures as a class as well as independently.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your portfolio will include the list of conjectures we develop as a class and your work toward understanding the conjectures. This will include experimentation, calculation, proofs of special cases, and efforts to extend the results beyond the special cases. (You can, and should, also include any conjectures you develop yourself.)
		</p>
        </subsubsection>
        <subsubsection xml:id="essays">
                <title>
                        Mathematical Autobiography
                </title>
                <p>
			One of the first assignments in the course will for you to read one or more brief autobiographies of contemporary mathematicians and then to write your own mathematical autobiography. 
			Your portfolio must contain both of these.
                </p>

        <subsubsection xml:id="sources">
                <title>
                        Citation of Sources
                </title>
                <p>
			If you make use of any outside resources for this class, you are required to cite those sources. (The particular format of citations is not important. However, <latex /> provides a method for citing sources and creating bibliographies which I can show you how to use.)
