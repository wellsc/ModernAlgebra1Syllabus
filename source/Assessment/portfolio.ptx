<p>
	During the first week of class, we will meet one-on-one to discuss
	what success in this class will look like for you and to develop a set of personalized
	goals.
	Remember that your goals are not about grades and grading, however. Instead consider your <em>learning</em>, and more generally what <em>success</em> in this course will be for you.
</p>
<p>
	Over the course of the semester, you will assemble a comprehensive portfolio that demonstrates that you have met the basic requirements for the course, but primarily focused on your progress toward your goals.
</p>
<p>
	As far as the basics, for each of the topics we study as a class, you are expected to learn be able to explain the importance of the topic, show a working knowledge of any techniques, and to reflect on how the topic relates to your goals and on the question of the nature of mathematics. As long as you are engaged in the course, this will not be an issue. If there are ever any problems with the basics, we will work together to resolve them. 
</p>
<p>Because this class is very small, we will be able to discuss your progress frequently. My plan is to take a few minutes each Thursday for you to plan, and a few minutes each Tuesday to check in with you. If we find that this is not a good use of class time, we will arrange to have meetings outside of class. 
I will provide feedback on your work and make suggestions for improvement as appropriate,
and you will revise as necessary.</p>
<p>
Your portfolio should begin with a guide, or road map, for the reader in which you discuss your progress and point out specific items of interest in the portfolio. Before each check-in, you will update your reader's guide to discuss your overall progress, and to highlight progress since the last check-in.  The reader's guide should <em>explicitly cite evidence</em> from your portfolio to support your reader's guide. (Something along the lines of <q>My work on the solution of the cubic in Section 4.1 shows progress toward my goal of learning new mathematical techniques.</q>)
</p>
<p>
	At each check-in, we will use your reader's guide to navigate the portfolio, and we will discuss your progress. In particular, we will focus on these questions:
	<ul>
		<li>What are you particularly proud of or excited about?</li>
		<li>What has been challenging?</li>
		<li>What do you plan to do next?, and</li>
		<li>What do you need from me (the instructor) to facilitate your progress toward your goals?</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Before your final portfolio conference, which will be during the week of final exams, you will submit your final portfolio (with a final version of your reader's guide), again citing items of interest. Then, based on your learning and progress toward your goals, you will tell me what grade you have earned for the course.
