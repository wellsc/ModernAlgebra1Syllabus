<p>
	During the first week of class, we will discuss
	what success in this class will look like in general and for you in particular, and we will develop a set of personalized goals.
	Remember that your goals are not about grades and grading, however. Instead consider your <em>learning</em>, and more generally what <em>success</em> in this course will be for you.
</p>
<p>
	Over the course of the semester, you will assemble a comprehensive portfolio focused on your goals and your progress toward them. For each of the topics we study, you are expected to learn the basics of the topic and then reflect on your goals and the goals of this class, to identify areas of strength and to determine what support you need.
</p>
<p>You are welcome to discuss your portfolio with me at any time and to seek my input and guidance on any items.
I will provide feedback on your work and make suggestions for improvement as appropriate and as you request.  
You may revise and resubmit any item, though I invite you to include a reflection on any revisions to demonstrate your growth in understanding.
</p>
<p>
Several times over the course of the semester (approximately every three to four weeks), we will schedule another one-on-one conference for a discussion of your goals, progress, and needed support.
Before each meeting, you will submit <em>a careful evaluation (your self-evaluation) of your
    progress toward your goals</em>, based on the criteria we established, along with a 
portfolio of items and evidence (as work in progress).  Please include
all versions and drafts of the items in your portfolio and any reflections on your progress. Your self-evaluation
should also <em>guide the reader</em> (me) and point to items from your portfolio that will
help the reader understand your self-evaluation and your progress.
</p>
<p>
Your portfolio should begin with a guide, or road map, for the reader in which you discuss your progress and point out specific items of interest in the portfolio. Before each check-in, you will update your reader's guide to discuss your overall progress, and to highlight progress since the last check-in.  The reader's guide should <em>explicitly cite evidence</em> from your portfolio to support your reader's guide. (Something along the lines of <q>My work on the solution of the cubic in Section 4.1 shows progress toward my goal of learning new mathematical techniques.</q>)
</p>
<p>
At each conference, you will explain your self-evaluation.  We will review
	your goals and your progress, plan next steps (which may include revision or extension), and discuss what support would be helpful to you in meeting your goals. 
In particular, we will focus on these questions:
	<ul>
		<li>What are you particularly proud of or excited about?</li>
		<li>What has been challenging?</li>
		<li>What do you plan to do next?, and</li>
		<li>What do you need from me (the instructor) to facilitate your progress toward your goals?</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Before your final portfolio conference, which will be during the week of final exams, you will submit your final portfolio (with a final version of your reader's guide), again citing items of interest. Then, based on your learning and progress toward your goals, you will tell me what grade you have earned for the course.
