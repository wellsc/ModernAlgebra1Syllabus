        <introduction>
                <p>
                        You can (and are encouraged to) include any items in your portfolio that shed light on the nature of mathematics or that demonstrate progress toward your individual goals. The following items are some things that previous students have chosen to include.

        <subsubsection xml:id="investigations">
                <title>
                        Details of Activities and Investigations
                </title>
                <p>
                       In addition to the synthesis for each activity, you may choose to include more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        For instance, you might include work to show that you have:
                <ul>
                <li>
                        <p>
                                gained additional depth of understanding of important concepts;
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <p>
                        understood the historical or philosophical importance of the topic;
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <p>
                        made connections to other topics in this course, in other courses, or to everyday life.
                        </p>
                </li>
        </ul>
</p>
</subsubsection>
<subsubsection xml:id="experimentation">
                <title>
                        Experiments and Explorations
                </title>
                <p>
		If there is a topic from class that you feel does not go far enough, you are free to investigate more deeply. For example, if you particularly enjoy historical connections, you might want to investigate some of the people behind the ideas and results we address in class.
                </p>

<subsubsection xml:id="summaries">
                <title>
                        Summaries of Outside Reading
                </title>
                <p>
		If you use outside sources to guide your learning, you may want to include more than just citations. You can summarize what you learned from those sources and include the summaries.
                </p>

<subsubsection xml:id="other">
        <title>
                Other Items
        </title>
        <p>
                Other items may be included in your Portfolio if you they demonstrate your progress in meeting your course goals.  Some examples of what you may choose to include are practice problems, conjectures, or expository papers.
