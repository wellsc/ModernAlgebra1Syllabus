        This course is an investigation of topics in Abstract Algebra, covering the basics of Rings, Fields, and Division Rings. Depending on progress and the interest of student and instructor, we may also investigate other topics in Abstract Algebra, such as groups and Galois theory.
</p>
<p>
In all topics, we will seek to further our understanding of mathematics as a whole, to explore
how abstract algebra developed through history, how abstract algebra is related
to other areas of mathematics and to fields outside of mathematics.
