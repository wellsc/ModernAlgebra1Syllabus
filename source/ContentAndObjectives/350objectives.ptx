<p>
	For some of these topics, we will use cryptography as an organizing and connecting principle due to its relevance to the real-world issue of online security.
</p>
<p>
We will also explore the (in my opinion underrepresented) roles of insight and creativity in the development of mathematics,
as well as the role of diligent, persistent work.
