                        Algebraic properties of the integers and the development of the rational, real, and complex number systems as algebraic structures. Topics from modern algebra include rings, integral domains, fields, and ring isomorphisms. Further study of algebraic structures using congruence arithmetic and factorization in the ring of integers and polynomial rings.

In all topics, we will seek to further our understanding of mathematics as a whole, to explore
how abstract algebra developed through history, how abstract algebra is related
to other areas of mathematics and to fields outside of mathematics.
