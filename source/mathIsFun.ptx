	<title>Math is fun!</title>
	<p>
			Many of you may have an experience of mathematics that does not suggest math is fun. Even if you know and appreciate the <em>usefulness</em> of math, the subject is often presented in a way that sucks all the fun out of it. Imagine sitting down to play a video game and finding that before you can actually start playing the game, you must first spend hours and hours memorizing cheat codes! <q>Now we need to master the <em>up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, Start</em> sequence and its variations. This will make later games easier. Enter this sequence 35 times on the next screen.</q>
	</p>
<p>
	This is nothing like what mathematics really is. Yes, sometimes memorizing techniques can make later things easier, but these techniques have deeper meanings and origins. They are not just a random sequence of buttons to push.
</p>
<p>
	Instead, mathematics is about analyzing situations, carefully describing or quantifying them, and looking for more or less universal patterns. That may still sound dry, but my personal goal in this class, in addition to giving you useful techniques, is to help you to see the beauty and joy of mathematics.
