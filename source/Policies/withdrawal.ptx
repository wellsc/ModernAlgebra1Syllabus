    <p>
    If you need accommodations due to a learning, physical, or other disability you must present a memo
    to me from
    <url href="http://www.gvsu.edu/dsr" visual='gvsu.edu/dsr'>Disability Support Resources</url> (DSR)
    indicating the existence of a disability and the suggested
    reasonable accommodations. 
    If you have not already done so, please contact the Disability Support Resources office,
    by calling 331-2490, emailing <email>dsrgvsu@gvsu.edu</email>, or visiting 4015 JHZ. 
    Please note that I am unable to provide accommodations based upon disability until I have received a copy
            of the DSR issued memo. For more information visit
    GVSU's <url href="http://www.gvsu.edu/dsr" visual="gvsu.edu/dsr">Disability Support Resources</url> webpage.

            Growth as a person does is certainly not limited to the classroom or academics. If there is an upcoming faith or religious observance that could have an impact on your attendance or work in the class, please <url href="https://www.gvsu.edu/affirmative/religious-request.htm" visual='gvsu.edu/affirmative/religious-request.htm'>submit a request</url> during the first two weeks of the semester, or as soon as is reasonably possible, so that we can plan together accordingly.

	    <title>Classroom and Campus Safety</title>
                <p>
                        I consider classroom and campus safety our shared responsibility.
                        Please familiarize yourself with the classroom emergency placard, which
                        contains important information that could prove useful should an emergency
                        arise.
                        Emergency situations could include a fire alarm, tornado warning, medical
                        emergency, or hostile intruder, and our response might consist of evacuating
                        the building in an orderly manner, moving as a group to a different location
                        in the building, rendering assistance a class member, or staying put and
                        locking the classroom door.
                        In all cases, I will provide clear instructions as to what you should do.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Please make sure to have your primary mobile number listed in Banner so that
                        you will automatically receive any campus alerts.
                        Should you receive an emergency notification in class, notify me
                        immediately.
