    <p>
    Work done in class in a timed setting are not expected to be typeset. Instead,
    digital scans of your initial work can be included in your portfolio.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, reflections on your work, revisions, and corrections are expected to follow the guidelines
    given for work in un-timed settings.
