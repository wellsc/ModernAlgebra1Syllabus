	    <introduction>
    <p>
    Learning cannot take place solely in the classroom.  As mentioned above, you
    should expect to put in considerable work outside of class.  Different students
    require different levels of support, and I am committed to providing you with
    the appropriate level of support that you require.
    </p>
    <p>
	    First, never hesitate to come to me during <xref ref="contact" text="custom">student hours</xref> or to
    make an appointment to see me.  My primary job is to facilitate your
    understanding and learning, so when you come to me you are allowing me to do my
    job well.
    </p>
    <p>
    You may also find that working with a group of classmates is beneficial.  I
    encourage you to form groups to work together outside of class.  Working with a
    group also allows you to see things from different perspectives. 
    </p>
    <p>
    If you or your study group have questions, please come to me and we will work through them together.
	    If my <xref ref="contact" text="custom">student hours</xref> are at times that you cannot make due to other commitments,
            <url href="mailto:wellsc@gvsu.edu" visual="mailto:wellsc@gvsu.edu">make an appointment</url> to see me at another
    time.
    </p>
    <p>
    Also, maximum benefit from this course can only be obtained through Attendance,
    Preparation, and Participation.

	    <title>Attendance</title>
    <p>
	    As discussed in <xref ref="assessment" />, attendance in class is an
    important part of this course.  You are expected to be present and on time each day we meet.  You
    are responsible for announcements made in class concerning material covered, assignments, changes in
    the syllabus or due dates, or anything else pertinent to the course.  Furthermore, many of the
    activities from class and reflections on class will become part of your portfolio.
    </p>
    <p>
	    Nevertheless, your health and safety and that of your classmates is important.  Therefore <em>if you are ill, stay at home</em>.  In the event of a University recognized absence, arrangements can be
    made for you to mitigate the effects of missing class.
    </p>

    <subsubsection xml:id="preparation">
    <title>Preparation</title>
    <p>
    It is imperative that you work on a consistent basis. 
    This applies to both the day-to-day work to prepare for class as well as the more long-term work such as the portfolio.   
    You should keep a well-organized record of your study notes, completed problems, and problems in
    progress for future reference. (Note that these are acceptable as part of your portfolio if you
    believe they help make your case!)
    </p>
    <p>
    You must understand that a great deal of your learning in this course must occur on your own.  
    It is your responsibility to complete assigned reading, read assignments carefully, complete the
    problems, be prepared for class, and to seek support as needed.
    </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection xml:id="participation">
    <title>Participation</title>
    <p>
    In every class meeting, there will be ample opportunity for you to actively participate.  Through
    questions asked, brief exercises for small teams of students, student presentations, and discussion
    of homework problems, you will be able to check and demonstrate your understanding of the material.
    You must be prepared and up to date to participate effectively.  
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition, you will have the opportunity to ask questions in class.  This is an important part of
    the learning process as I cannot respond to concepts that are causing you difficulty if I do not
    know about them.  I expect that everyone will share in this important part of the learning process
    for this course.
