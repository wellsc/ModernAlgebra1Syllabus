    All drafts of work (exercises, proofs, and expository writing, for
    example) that are submitted for feedback:
    <ul>
      <li>must be written using the software capable of high-quality mathematical typesetting or neatly hand-written and scanned. The <latex/> document preparation system (the standard in the
	      mathematical community) is recommended;(See <xref ref="mathematical-typesetting" />, <xref ref="mathematical-typesetting" text="title" />, for more information)</li>
      <li>must be spell-checked and proofread for grammatical correctness;</li>
      <li>must be submitted electronically (via BlackBoard or shared link); and</li>
      <li>must also be available in its original form (such as the original <latex/> (.tex) files and any other input files needed to generate
          the PDF).</li>
    </ul>
