    One of my goals for this course is to challenge you to grow intellectually while
    giving you the tools and environment that will allow you to succeed.  If you at
    any time feel that you are not being challenged to achieve your fullest
    potential in understanding the concepts we address, or if you have comments
    about the pace of the class or any other concerns, I encourage you to discuss
    your concerns with me during my <xref ref="contact" text="custom">student hours</xref> or an appointment with me.
    </p>

    As the mathematics capstone, you should expect the course to be challenging.  While we will all work
    to make time spent in class as productive as possible, it is not possible to learn everything using
    class time alone: much of your learning and understanding will occur as you reflect on what we have
    done in class, work on problems, and read and discuss course material outside of class.  
    </p>

    The most important rule for this course is <em>do not get behind in your work.</em>
    Using a portfolio removes the inherent penalties in a slow start, but the trade off is that it can
    be tempting to put things off until later.
    Always stay up to date with the material in this course.  Make succeeding in this course a priority!
