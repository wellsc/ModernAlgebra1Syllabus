Truth and honesty: The principles of truth and honesty are recognized as fundamental to a community of teachers and scholars. The university expects that both faculty members and students will honor these principles and in so doing protect the validity of university grades. This means that all academic work will be done by the student to whom it is assigned without unauthorized aid of any kind. Instructors, for their part, will exercise care in the planning and supervision of academic work, so that honest effort will be positively encouraged. Compliance shall include compliance with the following specific rules:
                        </p>
                        <p>
			<ol>
<li><p>No student shall knowingly, without authorization, procure, provide, or accept any materials which contain questions or answers to any examination or assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>No student shall, without authorization, complete, in part or in total, any examination or assignment for another person.</p></li>
<li><p>No student shall, without authorization, allow any examination or assignment to be completed, in part or in total, by another person.</p></li>
<li><p>No student shall knowingly plagiarize or copy the work of another person and submit it as his or her own.</p></li>
<li><p>No student shall submit work that has been previously graded or is being submitted concurrently to more than one course without authorization from the instructors of the classes to which the student wishes to submit it.</p></li>

			<p>
Any ideas or material taken from another source for either written or oral presentation must be fully acknowledged. Offering the work of someone else as one's own is plagiarism. The language or ideas taken from another may range from isolated formulas, sentences, or paragraphs to entire articles copied from books, periodicals, speeches, or the writing of other students. The offering of materials assembled or collected by others in the form of projects or collections without acknowledgment also is considered plagiarism. Any student who fails to give credit in written or oral work for the ideas or materials that have been taken from another is guilty of plagiarism.

Such activity may result in failure of a specific assignment, an entire course, or, if flagrant, dismissal from Grand Valley. For further information see Student Rights and Responsibilities.
